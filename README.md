This Github project contains all the work was done  for the project for the course of OC
that i have followed in 2023 in the IT departement of Turin.
## Objectives
Study the Multi commododities min cost flow problem and do some experimentation.

## Project Overview
We have studied the bibliography given by the professors and developed a 40 page paper on the subject of MC-MCF. We have approached the problem and the many resolution approaches in a theorical and practical way.
We have also tried to implement two of the resolution methods we have discussed and tried them on a dataset that represent a real-life scenario for the MC MCF.
